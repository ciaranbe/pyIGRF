pyIGRF is a simple Python package for evaluating the 13th generation of the International Geomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF-13) geomagnetic field model  released in December 2019.

The code runs a simple command-line driven menu which allows spot values of the seven main field components (Declination, Inclination, Total Field, Horizontal, North, East and Vertical strength, or D,I,F,H,X,Y,Z) and their respective secular variation to be computed for a given latitude, longitude, altitude and time.

Other options include computing a time-series of values for a location over a number of years, or computing values for a grid of latitude and longitude values for a particular date.

The code accepts geodetic (WGS-84) or geocentric coordinates and location values in decimal degree or degrees and minutes. 

IGRF-13 is valid from 01-Jan-1900 to 31-Dec-2024.
